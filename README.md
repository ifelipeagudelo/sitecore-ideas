# Sitecore Ideas

The repo is currently setup in different branches merged into the master:
- 'feature' also known as 'beta' - This is where the latest changes and files are, but you may also experience some issues with stability/crashes.
- 'master' also known as 'stable' - All the features are merged here and should be stable on this branch, and is generally well tested.
